**Casino**

Players can be added and removed from the casino. Each player has a name. The dice game is based on the fact that each player rolls 4 dice, then the score is counted for each player separately, according to:

Pair : dice result \* 2

Three same: dice result \* 4

Four same: dice result \* 6

Only even numbers: sum of points + 2

Only odd numbers: sum of points + 3

(if, for example, there is a pair at the same time and all digits are even, we take into account the better score. Example: for the system [6,6,6,2] we have a triple of sixes worth 24 points and even numbers alone worth 22 points, i.e. the whole set is worth 24 points)

At the end, the winner of the given game is indicated (or if several players had the same result, the game is considered inconclusive).
